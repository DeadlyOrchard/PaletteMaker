# PaletteMaker
A webapp that allows a user to create and edit a color palette.

I created a similar program using Python's Tkinter module, but I quickly realized how unrealistic it is for a user to download a program for this sort of task.
Rather than continuing with something no one will see, I adjusted the code into a webapp format. So far, all of the javascript is my own. Meaning, some of the methods may be...unorthodox.
I used external sources for styling the sliders while trying to handle browser inconsistencies.
