# PaletteMaker
A webapp that allows a user to create and edit a color palette.

I created a similar program using Python's Tkinter module, but I quickly realized how unrealistic it is for a user to download a program for this sort of task.
Rather than continuing with something no one will see, I adjusted the code into a webapp format. So far, all of the javascript is my own. Meaning, some of the methods may be...unorthodox.
I used external sources for styling the sliders while trying to handle browser inconsistencies. 

DONE\n
  User may edit color in either RGB or Hexcode format.

TO DO\n
  Hard\n
    User may edit colors by typing numbers directly into inputs rather than just sliders.
    A colorwheel display of the selected color.
    User may export entire color palette as a png.
  Easy\n
    User may add or remove colors
    User may edit color in either HSL or HSV format.
    User may copy any color to clipboard in the format that they are currently viewing (finished for Hex and RGB, not HSL or HSV)
